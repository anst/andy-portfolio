@Updates On the State of the Blog
<p>I haven't written in a long, <i>long</i> time. And while I can't attribute that to a single reason, I'd like to say that posts shall be more frequent from now on.</p>

<p>After a rather large downtime, my website was due for an upgrade. Coming from <a href="http://anchorcms.com">Anchor</a> as an easy-to-use blogging platform, I wanted something I can easily modify without a huge learning curve. I decided I wanted to return to a static-esque blogging system, and thankfully I had written <a href="https://github.com/anst/streak">a blogging system to do just that</a>, called Streak. Streak was a project I had written after attempting to set up a website using Rails and <a href="https://github.com/cloudhead/toto">Toto</a>. Having no previous experience with Rails, I lacked the ability to modify the code to my preference. Frustrated, I decided to write my own microframework in a software stack I felt comfortable in (PHP+Apache). I focused on 3 key features:</p>
<h3>Streak</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Interoperability With Current Infrastructure</li>
	<li>Easy Theming</li>
	<li>Low Requirements</li>
</ul>
<p>After several revisions, I had a product I was pleased with and quickly published it on Github. And then nothing happened. I promised I would use Streak for my site when I got around to it. In the meantime, I discovered <a href="http://twitter.com/idiot">VisualIdiot's</a> project, Anchor. Familiar with his work, I knew it would be awesome. It even had a growing community that had already made several themes and plugins. When the excuse finally came to set up a blog (my team's recent success at <a href="http://sturzu.org/2013/05/08/picoctf-2013-writeups">picoCTF</a>), I quickly installed Anchor and started writing.</p>

<p>My posts were a great success at least in my book. They quickly stole the number one search result spot on Google and had several great comments. Afterwards, I neglected to see that the shared hosting provider had sent me a renewal notice. Quickly, my site was suspended. Continuing to neglect the now defunct site, I had quickly gone past the maximum website storage time the host provided. Devastated, I decided to give up on the site altogether until recently. I checked Archive.org's <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130508045653/http://sturzu.org/blog/posts/picoctf-2013-writeups">WayBack Machine</a> to see if any of my pages were archived, and luckily all of my posts were preserved. Phew. I cloned a copy of Streak from the Github repo and quickly imported all of my posts. And after making several big changes and adding numerous features, I was happy with the outcome. I ordered a brand new VPS and transfered my nameservers back to the server. I'm glad I'm back administering Linux servers as the lack of control with shared hosts was quite the pain. </p>

<p>As I've said, I hope to continue more of these posts, hopefully showcasing some of the things I'll be doing later this year.</p>

<p>Stay tuned!</p>
